- Background color: Light beige (#f5f5dc) to create a sense of tranquility, referencing old scrolls and parchment.
- Accent color: Warm gold (#d4af37) to represent achievement and mastery, reminiscent of ninja equipment accents.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' for readability and modern aesthetic.
- Use icons with Japanese art style. Symbols should be inspired by elements of nature (fire, water, wind, lightning, earth), ninja tools, and concepts of focus/meditation.
- Clean and minimalist design. Arrange task list like vertical scrolls with clear hierarchies. Utilize Zen garden principles of whitespace.
- Subtle animations when tasks are completed. Display shurikens slashing when deleting the tasks.
